# Tech Summarizer

---

## Project Overview

The **Tech Summarizer** is a Python-based project developed for analyzing product reviews and generating a concise summary along with overall sentiment feedback. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**, the project extracts important insights from multiple reviews, identifies positive and negative feedback, and presents an overall evaluation.

This project was submitted as part of an **AI Internship** program.

## Problem Statement

In the era of online shopping and product reviews, analyzing large volumes of textual data manually is time-consuming and inefficient. The problem addressed by this project is to automate the process of summarizing customer reviews, understanding the general sentiment, and providing an overall feedback report that can help users and companies make informed decisions.

## Objective

- To read and process multiple textual reviews from a file.  
- To perform sentiment analysis and categorize reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.  
- To generate a meaningful summary highlighting key points from the reviews.  
- To save the summarized report for easy reference.

---

## Features

- **Automatic Review Analysis:** Processes multiple reviews in one go.  
- **Sentiment Detection:** Identifies overall sentiment of the reviews.  
- **Extractive Summarization:** Highlights the most important points from reviews.  
- **Easy-to-Use:** Input reviews via a simple text file and get the summarized output.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x** – Programming language  
- **NLTK** – For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stopword removal  
- **TextBlob** – For sentiment analysis  
- **Re (Regular Expressions)** – For text preprocessing  
- **Collections** – For counting frequently used words

## Sample Input (Reviews)

- The laptop feels solid and premium in hand.  
- Battery backup easily lasts 7 hours with normal use.  
- The keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions.  
- The speakers lack bass and sound tinny at high volume.  
- The laptop gets very hot under heavy load.  

---

## Sample Output (Summary and Sentiment)

- **Sentiment Score:** 0.36  
- **Overall Feedback:** Overall Positive  

**Summary:**  
The laptop feels premium and performs smoothly for most tasks.  
Battery backup lasts long, and the keyboard is comfortable.  
However, the speakers lack bass, and the system heats up under heavy load.

## Conclusion

The **Tech Summarizer** successfully demonstrates how NLP techniques can be applied to real-world textual data to extract insights and summarize information efficiently. It can be extended to analyze reviews for other products, services, or any textual dataset where sentiment and key points are valuable.  

This project provides a practical example of how AI and NLP can assist in decision-making and customer feedback analysis.
